							One of the most distinguished aspects of storytelling is the dialogue between the speaker and their listeners. These two develop a connection with one another through their mutual experience of the story. While the speaker reveals themselves through their story the listeners reveals themselves through their understanding and perception of the story.

						<p id="triggerReveal0">
							Social media platforms are laying out different ways for sharing information, emotions, ideas and day to day events. They are not only providing users space to share their story, but also providing room for comments, questions and conversations regardless of the time or location.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							With the constant increase of technological development in communication it is important to understand how the shift from face-to-face interactions as a predominant mean of communication to computer-mediated interactions would affect society.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Communication media has changed the interaction between the speaker and the listener. It is shaping the story within media itself and it is continuously transforming social practices.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The question which arises here and that intrigues me the most is how the mediation of social experiences influenced social norms and roles, especially media's effects on concepts such as social reality, socialization and social change?

	          				My research began with my personal fascination for the recently developed methods of communication. Particularly on social media platforms. What intrigues me the most is the practice of non-traditional storytelling that we encounter on those platforms.
	          			</p>
	          			<br>
						<p>
							To better understand what storytelling is, and how it developed into its contemporary form we must go as far back as the beginning of human history. It is considered that storytelling originated long before language. While in the beginning stories were narrated visually, one of the earliest pieces of evidence of storytelling are the cave drawings in Chauvet, France, which date as far back as 30,000 years ago.
							<a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a>
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Stories later shifted into oral traditions and were passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. These traditions could take many forms such as epic poems, chants, rhymes, songs and more. In the book "21st century anthropology: a reference handbook" academic Katie Elson Anderson defines storytelling as "the oldest and newest form of arts".
							<a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a>
							For the pre-literate societies, visual and oral traditions were the only way to pass on important cultural and historical information and it’s one of the main factors for such an ancient records to be preserved up to this day.
						</p>

						<br>
						<p id="triggerReveal1">
							Stories marked the beginning and transfer of knowledge one could boldly claim, they were our first teachers, they taught us how to make sense of the world and they brought us together in order to create our first communities.  
							Storytelling has always been a social activity in its nature. Stories have been a part of humanity since people were able to communicate and respond to the basic urge to explain, educate and enlighten. Stories bring communities together with a shared emotional event and helps them to relate to each other and the world around them.

							One of the most distinguished aspects of storytelling is the intimacy between the speaker and their listeners. They develop a connection to one another. The speaker reveals themselve through their story and the listeners reveal themselves through their understanding and perception of the story.
							<a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a>
						</p>

						<br>

						<p id="triggerReveal2">
							Storytelling is not purely about speaking and listening, but also about acting, seeing and imagining. There is an interactive and performative side to storytelling, which is contributing to the storyline in some way or another. The non-verbal communication such as the amount of eye contact between the speaker and the listener, the use of gestures, the facial expressions as well as the tone of the voice will be adjusted depending on the reaction of the audience.
						</p>

						<br>

						<p>
							Stories in the past were not as formal as today. Due to the development of languages as well as the advancing informational technologies, such as the printing press, the camera, the tv, the internet and its social media platforms, stories have transformed drastically into delicately polished units of information. The function of the story has not changed, but it's nature and the means by which storytelling takes place have.

							Social media platforms are not only providing space for users to share their story, but also a room for comments, questions and conversations regardless of the time and location. They are laying out different ways for sharing information, emotions, ideas and day to day events. With the constant increase of technological development in basic communication it is important to understand how the shift from face-to-face interactions as a main mean of communication to computer-mediated interactions would affect the dialogue between the speaker and the listener.
						</p>

						<br>

						<p id="triggerReveal3">
							Communication media has changed the interaction between users, it has transformed the relationship between media and social practices and is constantly shaping the story within the media itself. In the book "Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man"
							Marshall McLuhan argues that "Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of communication".<a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a>

	          				Nonverbal communication has always been an essential part of the dialogue between the speaker and the listener. In many cases it can successfully replace verbal communication. An estimate 60 to 65 percent of interpersonal communication is conveyed through nonverbal cues.<a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a> For instance, the reaction of the listener, eye-contact, facial-expressions, gestures, movement, touch, and others.

	          				Most of the time nonverbal behaviors are unconscious and may portray a more accurate presentation of the listener’s attitude and emotional state. It exposes whether the person you are talking to understands you, to what extend they are being truthful and how well are they listening.

	          				Nonverbal communication can be perceived as an integral skill of social competence. According to Professors Feldman, R. S., Philippot, P., & Custrini, R. J. ‘social competence’ is a “hypothetical construct relating to evaluative judgments of the adequacy of a person’s performance [within the context of a social interaction]”<a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a> Other consider social competence as a combination of knowledge and the translation of that knowledge into performance.<a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a>

	          				In "The Handbook of Communication Skills" Professor Owen Hargie argues that "An important distinction in viewing nonverbal behavior as communication is that between the encoder and the decoder. The encoder is analogous to an actor or impression manager, producing and ‘sending’ the behaviors to be interpreted. The decoder is analogous to an observer ‘receiving’ the presented behaviors and interpreting them in some fashion. Within the context of the encoder-decoder distinction, a major concern is that of intention and whether intended and unintended messages obey the same rules and principles of communication.”<a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a>

Thus, both intentional and unintentional units of information are constantly being given off by either one of the participants and have integral role in the absolute communication between the givers.

 							Therefore, these new forms of power are becoming increasingly threatening. Although this concern exists among many media scholars, it is uncertain to what extent users are worried about participatory culture.

							Since, the speaker is expected to fit within the needs and reactions of the audience, style can be observed as an essential speaker’s response to their audience. It is inevitable that language goes through processes of styling depending on the dynamics between the speaker and their listeners.<a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote"></a>
							Therefore language becomes a tool for meaning making and meaning exchange that arises from the individuals motivation to create commonness of mental and emotional states.

							Communication is a mutual action, which is necessary to be synchronized in process and content. In order to achieve this goal, the speaker is responsible for taking in consideration the characteristics of their listeners as well as the context of the situation. The speaker got to know quite clearly with whom they interacted, therefore how they should interact.
	          			</p>
	          			<br>
	          			<p id="first-paragraph"> 
							The role of the audience in communication has been recognized as an ongoing public, collaborative nature of interactions across context. Various scholars have analyzed the 'discursive' and 'inter-subjective' relationship between the speaker and the importance of the audience to the on-gong interaction in the dialogue.<a href="#fn:30" rel="footnote"></a>
							The way that audience are conceptualized is shaped by their identities and cognition. Academic study on this topic has demonstrated how audience are connected to power dynamics and the pursuit of social justice to ensure that all of them are seen and heard.<a href="#fn:31" rel="footnote"></a>
	          			</p>
	          			<br>
	          			<p id="first-paragraph">
							Nevertheless the speaker can also re-define existing situations by using style as initiative. Initiative style-shift refers to situations where the speaker does not accommodate to the speech style of their immediate audience, but rather creatively uses language features, towards an absent reference group.<a href="#fn:32" rel="footnote"></a> Such style-shifting is widespread in mass communication. In the age of social media, where many social groups exist within one space, interacting simultaneously with all of them becomes significantly more complex.

							‘Context collapse’ is a concept that is flattening multiple audiences into a single context.<a href="#fn:33" rel="footnote"></a> It refers to the infinite possibilities of online audience, opposed to the limited group a person can normally interact with during face-to-face communication. In situations of context collapse the adjustment of specific characteristics of the interaction to fit certain social or cultural dimension becomes more or less impossible.<br>
 							The term 'context collapse' is used by academics to conceptualize the effects on 'speaker-listener' interactions as a consequence of the mediation technologies we associate with the Web 2.0.<a href="#fn:34" rel="footnote"></a>  It is important to understand how the advances of such technologies, which are providing compelling and interactive user experiences have fundamentally altered the way individuals engage and connect with each other. As people communicate through digital agents, they are forced to express their act in new ways, adjusted and limited to the media itself.

							Although users don't know exactly who their audience is consisted of, they have a mental picture of who they’re writing or speaking to – the audience involved. Users on social media platforms have assumptions about the range of audience they are addressing. Therefore, they are adjusting their online speaking and writing to match certain contextual dimensions.

							When context easily collapses, messages become exposed in an out-of-context manner. A social media platform like Facebook has a unique, fragmented-like features of narrativity. The News Feed page is a great example of various stories being reported world-wide, informing us on certain series of events. Traditionally a story presumes a specific time-based process following a continuous linearity of events. In the case of social media, the story is being fragmented.

							Most narratives posted in social media are bits of stories, thoughts and ideas within a highly narrow framework. Because of the thematic diversity one can find an opinion that was fully written in personal tone, followed by an article about scientific experiment, followed by a customised advertisement, followed by a video taken on the beach and so on. Therefore, no event is seen in terms of its original context.

	          			<br>
	          			<p id="first-paragraph">
							Although social interactions don't require a lot of conscious effort, there are complex processes continuously going on. One should always observe the situation, read the contextual cues, adjust their behavior and speech depending on other's reactions as well as they must consider what is socially acceptable. In all forms of interactions, identity, context, performance and regulation are continuously utilizing and interacting.

							The underlying architecture of computer-mediated environments provide completely different forms of context and interaction than the ones we naturally became familiar with, such as linear narrativity and responsive interaction between participants. Therefore the absence of embodiment creates a gap between the way in which one present itself and the way in which others perceive them.

							There are many forms of new media technologies which have taken hold in the paradigm of communication. Computer-mediated communication is constantly trying to effectively replicate essential characteristics of interaction, natural to vis-à-vis setting, in order to acquire functional means of conveyance. Nevertheless it withholds many of the conversational cues existing during such interactions, resulting in less efficacious mean of communication when more complex social dynamics are present.  
	          			</p> 
	          			<br>
	          			<p id="first-paragraph">
							A reason for digital technology not to be able to substitute co-present interactions is because computer-mediated communication negotiates our social reality through digital medium that passes on secondhand or third-party information which cannot be directly observed. This implies that such mediated communication might be used and perceived differently by participants during an interaction.

							The ability of the users to communicate effectively through such media platforms has proved to have limited capabilities, since it is fully dependent on the media itself. As a consequence of which communication practices became significantly altered. For example, since the attention span of a person is significantly determined by the content they are being exposed to, a collective attention deficit is becoming more and more visible.

							The social effects of technologies are almost immediate. The uses of a certain medium come from its inherent attributes. They are interfering with our perception much more than they are influenced by it. Therefore the functionality of the media is forcing users to frame their expressions within the limited canvas of the mediator itself.<br>
							It is important to understand how such mediated form of communication is constantly influencing social norms and social experiences as well as successively modifying interaction among users.

							Media has always played a fundamental part regarding the means by which society communicates. When used effectively, any medium is a vehicle for unpacking ideas, emotions, thoughts, beliefs, etc. Developing a deeper understanding of this can change our perception of the ways in which a given medium can influence society. As well as the fact that the same medium carries in itself a certain message and its effect is measured by the overall impact on social reality.<br>
							No matter the form of the message, it is certain that both the message and the means by which it is carried have drastically influenced socialization throughout human history.

							Primitive societies painted their stories on the walls. Ancient Greeks craved their language to keep record of how history is moving forward. With the evolution of the written word, stories developed into narratives, creating cohesive works. 
							The invention of the printing press and the newspaper was a step further for the spread-ability of a  story. Furthermore, the camera allowed even more vivid and accurate representation of it.<br>
							In the age of global communication and social media, the story transformed into digital units of information, combining all previous forms of storytelling, which can moreover be spread in a matter of seconds.

	          			<br>
	          			<p id="first-paragraph">
							The rather new medium of digital storytelling altered once more the way human communicate with each other and the relationship between the teller and the listener. This leads to a conclusion that although people are unquestionably the creators of their stories, stories and narratives are by all means a co-product of the mediator.

							Stories have always been flexible in nature. In order to exists they have to fit into a certain framework. The medium will inform the message in a certain way. It will give it an extra layer of complexity and it will nuance it. The same story told in a different medium will require a totally different approach.  Oral traditions have different characteristics than written texts, movies, television, social media and so on. The medium can either contribute to the story or the opposite, withhold significantly important aspects of it.
